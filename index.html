					<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
					<h1>Artist-Researcher-Teacher</h1>
					<p>In adopting the embodied practice of becoming a/r/tographer you have a rich and deep methodology for creating, reflecting, and inspiring. As artist you develop a studio practice for the creation of skills, data, and reflection points to better inform your pedagogical practices. As researcher you seek knowledge from your mentors, peers, and academic voices. Synthesise, reflect and expand on these ideas. As teacher you facilitate student learning and growth using investigated and iterated strategies and philosophies. The multi-faceted nature of artist/researcher/teacher interconnects to create a deep and ongoing source of learning to drive your pedagogical practice. Let each component reflect and inform the others, this is a holistic and ongoing tradition.</p>

					<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
					<h1>Wide-Awakeness</h1>
					<p>This is the act of being in the world. Wide-awakeness embodies a relational practice to search for meaning with open eyes and self-awareness. This requires a commitment to engage in action-taking for the creation of a purposefully designed life. As an artist and educator you need this perspective to remain open to all possibilities. As a teacher you need this awareness and presence to truly collaborate with students to fuel their curiosity and quest for understanding. A student-centred curriculum is instrumental in allowing students to participate in transformative learning experiences. By guiding students in navigating all the possibilities that surround them you can inspire a room of self-confident, critical, and creative thinkers. A wide-awake classroom is a deeply positive space where unlimited creative imagination is championed and student agency reigns supreme.</p>

					<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
					<h1>Personalised-Learning</h1>
					<p>In your classroom you recognise the inherent artistry in everyone and strive to create effective and authentic personalised learning experiences for each student. You develop a curriculum and content to provide focused learning outcomes that remain flexible and open to adaption. Students develop confidence in self-directed studio practices and engage in open dialogue and the authentic communication of their ideas in a democratic classroom. As a teacher you encourage this wholeheartedly and practice active listening to truly understand your students and their needs. By making personalised learning a part of your pedagogy you create an environment where student agency is rewarded with tailored and thoughtful teaching. Everyone benefits from the acknowledgement of each student’s individuality in a space dedicated to self-expression, choice, and respect.</p>

					<h1>Chapter 4</h1>
					<h1>Creativity</h1>
					<p>A crucial element to bring to your classroom is creativity. As an artist you readily embrace creativity, now draw from this to design engaging learning experiences for your students. You develop curriculum and content that is willing to constantly be reimagined in response to student input and collaboration. Their creativity will show in different ways, be mindful and awake to the needs they express, and be ready to pivot to accommodate them. Foster a safe learning environment that encourages active engagement in play, mistake-making, experimentation, and collaboration. Allow students the freedom to explore and create with self-directed studio practice and open-ended assignments. Providing encouragement and feedback teaches students the importance of the creative process and develops confidence in embracing and expressing their creativity.</p>

					<h1>Chapter 5</h1>
					<h1>Reflection</h1>
					<p>You recognise the important role that reflection plays in the continual drive to improve and advance your pedagogical and teaching practices. It underpins the work you do in all aspects of being an artist, researcher, and teacher. By engaging in critical reflection you evaluate and develop ideas, uncovering authentic meaning in the process. This is an active and considered approach that leads to growth, development, and the design of actionable strategies. Reflection exists as both a tool for making meaning of past events and a useful instrument for forward planning. You teach the practice of refection in your classroom to help students develop self-awareness and understanding in their work and lives. The everyday use of critical reflection is a crucial skill for continued meaning-making and is important for both teacher and student.</p>

					<h1>Chapter 6</h1>
					<h1>Inclusivity</h1>
					<p>You are wide-awake to the needs of all your students and have researched and implemented teaching methods to accommodate the diversity in your classroom. By promoting ideals of equity, you create an environment of inclusivity where all students feel understood, respected, and represented. You acknowledge the barriers that prevent students being able to access and participate in their education, and in response use inclusion as a tool for social justice by ensuring everyone is given access to equitable learning opportunities. Activities and assessments are flexible and easily modified allowing stress-free differentiation of learning tasks for students. Inclusivity is promoted through the study of a wide variety of artists, perspectives, and different voices. Your students have positive and respectful beliefs creating an inclusive learning environment for all.</p>

					<h1>Chapter 7</h1>
					<h1>Cross Curriculum</h1>
					<p>To create holistic learning opportunities for your students you thoughtfully and effectively integrate the Victorian Curriculums cross-curriculum capabilities. By teaching the skills of critical and creative thinking you help students to better analyse, evaluate and reflect on ideas. The ethical capabilities teach students to be open-minded and compassionate in their approach to exploring issues and developing principles and beliefs. You place importance on the intercultural capabilities in planning content that advances understanding and respect for a rich diversity of artists, their work, and culture. Your classroom is a site for teaching the personal and social capabilities that support self-growth by promoting empathy, understanding, and respect. By creating an interconnected practice of art education and general capabilities you provide a rich and meaningful curriculum for student growth and wellbeing.</p>

					<h1>Chapter 8</h1>
					<h1>Obstacles</h1>
					<p>As an artist you might find it hard to believe, but some people don’t like making art! You will have students like this, and it is your goal to help them overcome the obstacles that stop them from engaging in creative play and artmaking. Perhaps it is a self-consciousness that stops certain students from participating, or an anxiety over not feeling “good enough” at art. There might exist a school culture that devalues art, leaving students reluctant to show an interest in it. Maybe there are cultural or linguistic factors you haven’t considered that impact students’ ability to participate. As a teacher you investigate the reasons students are disengaged and find effective, personalised strategies to assist them to feel comfortable with art-making and creative self-expression.</p>

					<h1>Chapter 9</h1>
					<h1>Fun</h1>
					<p>This is the beating heart of your teaching practice. You truly believe that fun is fundamental and needs to be encouraged, developed, and embraced in all aspects of life, especially in education. Your classroom is a joyous and playful space where students feel safe and supported to contribute and engage. There is an atmosphere of possibility and positivity that radiates through all aspects of learning and creating. Content is wide and varied, drawing from visual culture, contemporary concepts, and student interests to create compelling and entertaining lessons. Students engage in studio practice, collaboration, games, and play that allows for joyous experimentation, mistake-making and creative work. You aim to demonstrate that being an artist is so fun and rewarding that your students are driven to living a creative life.</p>

					<h1>Epilogue</h1>
					<p>This guide exists as a living document designed to be in continuous creation. On the one hand it is the result of my current reflective practice as artist-researcher. Each reflection point represents my current thinking on topics I see as important to a holistic pedagogical practice. On the other hand, this guide serves as a tool for continued reflection by my future teacher self. Each card can be read individually, or in combination, and acts as a reminder of the values and ideals reflected on and documented in the process of becoming teacher. Each sonic work has been specifically composed to accompany a card, enhancing reflection and embodied cognition. As I learn, more cards and soundscapes will be added, ultimately creating a rich and detailed account of my values and beliefs about teaching, learning, and art.</p>
