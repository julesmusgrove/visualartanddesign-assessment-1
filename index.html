                        <p>The following guide is a multi-media work combining text, images, and sound. It has been
                            created as a product of reflection, and for the purpose of reflecting on my ideas and values
                            relating to art, research, and teaching. I engaged in a writing practice of ‘The Hundreds’
                            (Berlant & Stewart, 2019) to catalogue and summaries my thoughts in short pieces of cohesive
                            and focused text. Each of these texts relates to a unique idea that was then depicted in a
                            visual representation on a card. Drawing inspiration from the design and history of tarot
                            cards, these illustrations are the founding elements in my personalised fortune telling
                            instrument. It is an inquiry-based work that seeks to consolidate my pedagogical ideals into
                            a stacked deck, each card acting as a touchstone, a reminder to be called upon when
                            needed.</p>
                        <p>Reflecting on my teaching practice led me to explore the nature of sound, deconstruction, and
                            composition. Through the creation of these sonic works, I was able to investigate my ideas
                            and understanding of readings and theoretical concepts. Audio samples from essays, academic
                            papers and discussions with peers served as a source for granular synthesis. The
                            sonification of academic content allowing me to modulate, manipulate and abstract original
                            meaning, creating new auditory environments for personal sense-making to occur. Field
                            recordings from my reflective walking practice served as a heartbeat, grounding the
                            arrangements in place and time. The process of composing these sonic works was a meditative
                            practice that encouraged deep thought; the perception and experience of sounds enabling
                            embodied cognition for greater meaning-making and reflection (Roddy, 2017).</p>

                        <p class="body">This is the act of being in the world. Wide-awakeness embodies a relational
                            practice
                            to search for meaning with open eyes and self-awareness. This requires a commitment to

                            action-taking
                            for the creation of a purposefully designed life. As an artist and educator you need this
                            perspective to
                            remain open to all possibilities. As a teacher you need this awareness and presence to truly
                            collaborate with
                            students to fuel their curiosity and quest for understanding. A student-centred curriculum
                            is
                            instrumental in allowing students to participate in transformative learning experiences. By

                            students in navigating all the possibilities that surround them you can inspire a room of
                            self-confident, critical, and creative thinkers. A wide-awake classroom is a deeply positive
                            space where
                            unlimited creative imagination is championed and student agency reigns supreme.</p>

                            readily
                            embrace
                            creativity,
                            now draw from this to design engaging learning experiences for your students. You develop
                            curriculum and
                            content that is willing to constantly be reimagined in response to student input and
                            collaboration.
                            Their creativity will show in different ways, be mindful and awake to the needs they
                            express,
                            and be
                            ready to pivot to accommodate them. Foster a safe learning environment that encourages
                            active
                            engagement
                            in play, mistake-making, experimentation, and collaboration. Allow students the freedom to
                            explore and
                            create with self-directed studio practice and open-ended assignments. Providing

                            and
                            feedback teaches students the importance of the creative process and develops confidence in
                            embracing

                        <p class="body">You recognise the important role that reflection plays in the continual drive to
                            improve and
                            advance your
                            pedagogical and teaching practices. It underpins the work you do in all aspects of being an
                            artist,
                            researcher, and teacher. By engaging in critical reflection you evaluate and develop ideas,
                            uncovering
                            authentic meaning in the process. This is an active and considered approach that leads to
                            growth,
                            development, and the design of actionable strategies. Reflection exists as both a tool for
                            making
                            meaning of past events and a useful instrument for forward planning. You teach the practice
                            of
                            refection
                            in your classroom to help students develop self-awareness and understanding in their work
                            and
                            lives. The
                            everyday use of critical reflection is a crucial skill for continued meaning-making and is
                            important for
                            both teacher and student.</p>

                            to accommodate the diversity in your classroom. By promoting ideals of equity, you create an

                        <p class="body">As an artist you might find it hard to believe, but some people don’t like
                            making
                            art! You will have
                            students like this, and it is your goal to help them overcome the obstacles that stop them
                            from
                            engaging
                            in creative play and artmaking. Perhaps it is a self-consciousness that stops certain
                            students
                            from
                            participating, or an anxiety over not feeling “good enough” at art. There might exist a
                            school
                            culture
                            that devalues art, leaving students reluctant to show an interest in it. Maybe there are
                            cultural or
                            linguistic factors you haven’t considered that impact students’ ability to participate. As a
                            teacher you
                            investigate the reasons students are disengaged and find effective, personalised strategies
                            to
                            assist
                            them to feel comfortable with art-making and creative self-expression.</p>

                            is
                            fundamental
                            and needs
                            to be encouraged, developed, and embraced in all aspects of life, especially in education.
                            Your
                            classroom is a joyous and playful space where students feel safe and supported to contribute
                            and
                            engage.
                            There is an atmosphere of possibility and positivity that radiates through all aspects of
                            learning and
                            creating. Content is wide and varied, drawing from visual culture, contemporary concepts,
                            and
                            student
                            interests to create compelling and entertaining lessons. Students engage in studio practice,
                            collaboration, games, and play that allows for joyous experimentation, mistake-making and
                            creative work.
                            You aim to demonstrate that being an artist is so fun and rewarding that your students are
                            driven to
                            living a creative life.</p>

                    <p class="body">This guide exists as a living document designed to be in continuous
                        creation. On
                        the
                        one hand it
                        is the
                        result of my current reflective practice as artist-researcher. Each reflection point
                        represents
                        my
                        current thinking on topics I see as important to a holistic pedagogical practice. On the
                        other
                        hand,
                        this guide serves as a tool for continued reflection by my future teacher self. Each
                        card
                        can be
                        read
                        individually, or in combination, and acts as a reminder of the values and ideals
                        reflected
                        on
                        and
                        documented in the process of becoming teacher. Each sonic work has been specifically
                        composed to
                        accompany a card, enhancing reflection and embodied cognition. As I learn, more cards
                        and
                        soundscapes
                        will be added, ultimately creating a rich and detailed account of my values and beliefs
                        about
                        teaching,
                        learning, and art.</p>
